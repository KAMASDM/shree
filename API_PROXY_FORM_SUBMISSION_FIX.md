# API Proxy Fix for Form Submissions

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem:
Form submissions were failing with **405 Method Not Allowed** error:
```
POST https://shreedhargroup.com/api/proxy/leads/submit 405 (Method Not Allowed)
```

### Root Cause:
The Next.js App Router dynamic route `api/proxy/[...path]/route.js` was not properly handling all POST requests in production, particularly for form submissions.

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Specific Proxy Routes Created**
Created dedicated proxy routes for all form submission endpoints:

- ✅ `/api/proxy/leads/submit/route.js` - Contact form submissions
- ✅ `/api/proxy/inquiries/product/route.js` - Product inquiry forms  
- ✅ `/api/proxy/inquiries/service/route.js` - Service inquiry forms
- ✅ `/api/proxy/hr/applications/route.js` - Career application forms

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
Each specific route includes:
- ✅ **Detailed logging** for debugging
- ✅ **Proper CORS headers** for cross-origin requests
- ✅ **Error responses** with specific endpoint information
- ✅ **OPTIONS handling** for preflight requests

### 3. **Improved General Proxy**
Enhanced the general proxy route with:
- ✅ **Better logging** to track requests
- ✅ **Header debugging** to identify issues
- ✅ **Request body logging** for troubleshooting

## 📝 Form Submission Endpoints

### Backend API Endpoints:
- `POST /leads/submit/` - General contact and feedback forms
- `POST /inquiries/product/` - Product-specific inquiries
- `POST /inquiries/service/` - Service-related inquiries  
- `POST /hr/applications/` - Career applications (with file uploads)

### Proxy Routes:
- `POST /api/proxy/leads/submit/` ➜ Contact/Feedback forms
- `POST /api/proxy/inquiries/product/` ➜ Product inquiries
- `POST /api/proxy/inquiries/service/` ➜ Service inquiries
- `POST /api/proxy/hr/applications/` ➜ Career applications

## 🚀 Testing & Verification

### 1. **Backend API Test** (Working ✅)
```bash
curl -X POST https://sweekarme.in/shree/api/leads/submit/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"test","email":"test@example.com","phone":"1234567890","message":"test","source":"contact_us"}'
```

**Response:** `201 Created` with lead ID

### 2. **Production Proxy Test** (Should work now ✅)
```bash
curl -X POST https://shreedhargroup.com/api/proxy/leads/submit/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"test","email":"test@example.com","phone":"1234567890","message":"test","source":"contact_us"}'
```

## 🔍 Debugging Features

### Console Logs Added:
- ✅ Request method and path logging
- ✅ Request headers and body logging
- ✅ Backend URL construction logging
- ✅ Backend response status and data logging
- ✅ Error details with specific endpoint information

### Log Output Example:
```
🚀 Proxying POST request to: https://sweekarme.in/shree/api/leads/submit/
📦 Request body: {"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"...}
📨 Backend response status: 201
📨 Backend response: {"id":41,"name":"John Doe"...}
```
